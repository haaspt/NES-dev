## Overview

This project is my attempt to learn 6502 assembly for the NES.

## To Run

Load `helloworld.nes` into your favorite NES emulator.

## To Build

Compilation requires the [cc65 compiler](https://github.com/cc65/cc65). Installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Installing_CC65).

To generate a new `.nes` ROM run the following:

```bash
make
```

## Credits

The code and assets in this repo are mainly derived from Kevin Zurawel's excellent [Famicon Party tutorial](https://blog.famicom.party/).

Built using the [cc65 compiler](https://cc65.github.io/).

Original graphics data from Kevin Zurawel, further modified and layed out using [NESTool](https://github.com/jpwhiting/nestool).

Many thanks to the NES Dev wiki and developer community for tons of documentation and forum posts.
